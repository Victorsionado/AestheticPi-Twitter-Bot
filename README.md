# Image-Web-Scraper

Hi, I am Victor, this project is being used to tweet in my twitter account: Twitter.com/AestheticPi. 

I made this project for myself but I publish it because a lot people on the Internet helped me finish it and it does not only belong to myself. 
That being said, enjoy the code and happy coding.

Information.py will scrap the images we seek in order to be posted on our twitter account.
Testing.py will retreave the information for Post.py to work as it has to.
Post.py is the main file which posts the images on our twitter account.
Links.py will work with a different Twitter account which replies to the main account so it can show where the image was taken from.
